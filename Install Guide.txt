Download the files if you have not already and extract them to any folder you want that you can remember in case things break.

Run Install_LRZ.bat file, this file makes needed folders and copies files to correct folders

Next you can run "Start Plutonium without update.bat" file to open plutonium without removing needed files. 

You are done.

(original plutonium launcher updates all files when opened and this replaces "privategamelobby_project.lua" which is used to show LRZ & CUSTOM SURVIVAL MAPS option in private game lobby.)

IF YOU USED UPDATER LAUNCHER TO UPDATE FILES OR BY MISTAKE RUN "Install_LRZ.bat" AGAIN.

"Start Plutonium without update.bat" opens "%localappdata%\Plutonium\bin\plutonium-launcher-win32.exe" instead of the original launcher which updates all files.

 Survival maps can be chosen by selecting map in MAP and then selecting CUSTOM SURVIVAL MAP.

 After selecting custom survival map you can use START MATCH to play.
